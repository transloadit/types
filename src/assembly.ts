    .describe(`As briefly touched on in our [concepts](https://transloadit.com/docs/getting-started/concepts/), Transloadit supports two basic modes of operation:

- <strong><dfn>Sync Mode</dfn>:</strong> where the client waits for encoding to complete and then optionally notifies your back-end.
- <strong><dfn>Async Mode</dfn>:</strong> where the client resumes as soon as uploading is done, and Transloadit notifies your back-end when encoding completes.

<dfn>Async Mode</dfn> is slightly more work to set up, but recommended as it results in:

- A smoother user experience â€” the user does not have to wait on encoding.
- Reliability â€” we can retry encoding as well as sending Notifications.

To get the results to your back-end, Transloadit sends an Assembly Notification to your back-end. This is a multipart POST with a field called \`transloadit\`, which contains the full <dfn>Assembly Status JSON</dfn>. You can find an example of this in our [API Response docs](https://transloadit.com/docs/api/response-codes/).

You specify where we should send this payload in a \`notify_url\`, like so:

\`\`\`json
{
  "steps": { ... },
  "notify_url": "https://example.com/transloadit_pingback"
}
\`\`\`

Your back-end needs to respond with a \`200\` header, otherwise Transloadit assumes the Notification has failed and retries 5 times over a period of 20 minutes.

When you add a \`notify_url\`, Transloadit is going to inform your back-end, no matter your client integration. If you don't want your users/program to wait for encoding, this often also involves setting a flag. In the case of [Uppy](https://transloadit.com/docs/sdks/uppy/), set the \`waitForEncoding\` parameter to \`false\`. In many back-end SDKs, waiting for encoding involves explicitly polling the <dfn>Assembly Status</dfn>, so just refraining from that will do the trick.

If set to true, the result of this Step will be present. If files from that Step weren't exported to your storage, their location will be set to a temporary URL.

By default, we set this to true for leaf Steps and false for any intermediate Step.

Explicitly setting it to false can be a useful tool in keeping the Assembly Status JSON small.

Setting result: true on storage Steps does not add those Steps to the Assembly JSON, but only changes the returned URL values for the results of any transcoding Steps passed into those storage Steps. If you pipe a transcoding Step into multiple storage Steps (for example /s3/store) with each having result: true, then multiple results for this transcoding Step will be added to the Assembly JSON, giving you a quick overview of all file URLs for the various S3 buckets (in this example).`),

By default Robots ignore files they are not familiar with. ðŸ¤–/video/encode, for example, will happily ignore and refuse to emit images.
