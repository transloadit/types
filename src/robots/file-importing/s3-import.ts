While we recommend to use <dfn>Template Credentials</dfn> at all times,
some use cases demand dynamic credentials for which using
<dfn>Template Credentials</dfn> is too unwieldy because of their static
nature. If you have this requirement, feel free to use the following
parameters instead: \`"bucket"\`, \`"bucket_region"\` (for example:
\`"us-east-1"\` or \`"eu-west-2"\`), \`"key"\`, \`"secret"\`.

points to a file, only this file will be imported. For example:
\`images/avatar.jpg\`.

If it points to a directory, indicated by a trailing slash (\`/\`), then all
files that are direct descendants to this directory will be imported. For
example: \`images/\`.

Directories are **not** imported recursively. If you want to import
files from subdirectories and sub-subdirectories, enable the \`recursive\` parameter.

If you want to import all files from the root directory, please use \`/\` as
the value here. In this case, make sure all your objects belong to a path.
If you have objects in the root of your bucket that aren't prefixed with
\`/\`, you'll receive an error: \`A client error (NoSuchKey) occurred when
calling the GetObject operation: The specified key does not exist.\`

You can also use an array of path strings here to import multiple paths in
the same <dfn>Robot</dfn>'s <dfn>Step</dfn>.
