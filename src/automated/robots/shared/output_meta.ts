  .optional().describe(`Allows you to specify a set of metadata that is more expensive on CPU
power to calculate, and thus is disabled by default to keep your Assemblies
processing fast.

For images, you can add \`"has_transparency": true\` in this object to extract if the
image contains transparent parts and \`"dominant_colors": true\` to extract
an array of hexadecimal color codes from the image.

For videos, you can add the \`"colorspace: true"\` parameter to extract the colorspace of the 
output video.

For audio, you can add \`"mean_volume": true\` to get a single value representing the 
mean average volume of the audio file.

You can also set this to \`false\` to skip metadata extraction and speed up
transcoding.
