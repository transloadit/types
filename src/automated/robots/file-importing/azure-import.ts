Container, Account and Key.

While we recommend to use <dfn>Template Credentials</dfn> at all times,
some use cases demand dynamic credentials for which using
<dfn>Template Credentials</dfn> is too unwieldy because of their static
nature. If you have this requirement, feel free to use the following
parameters instead: \`"account"\`, \`"key"\`, \`"container"\`.

points to a file, only this file will be imported. For example:
\`images/avatar.jpg\`.

If it points to a directory, indicated by a trailing slash (\`/\`), then all
files that are descendants of this directory are recursively imported.
For example: \`images/\`.

If you want to import all files from the root directory, please use \`/\` as
the value here.

You can also use an array of path strings here to import multiple paths in
the same <dfn>Robot</dfn>'s <dfn>Step</dfn>.

You might see an error when trying to extract metadata from your imported
files. This happens, for example, for files with a size of zero bytes.
Including \`"meta"\` in the array will cause the <dfn>Robot</dfn>
to not stop the import (and the entire <dfn>Assembly</dfn>) when that happens.

Including \`"import"\` in the array will ensure the <dfn>Robot</dfn> does
not cease to function on any import errors either.

To keep backwards compatibility, setting this parameter to \`true\` will set
it to \`["meta", "import"]\` internally.
