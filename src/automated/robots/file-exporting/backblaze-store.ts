To create your credential information, head over to Backblaze, sign in to
your account, and select "Create a Bucket". Save the name of your bucket,
and click on the "App Keys" tab, scroll to the bottom of the page then
select ‚ÄúAdd a New Application Key‚Äù. Allow access to your recently created
bucket, select  ‚ÄúRead and Write‚Äù as your type of access, and tick the
‚ÄúAllow List All Bucket Names‚Äù option.

Now that everything is in place, create your key, and take note of the
information you are given so you can input the information into your

‚ö†Ô∏è Your App Key will only be viewable once, so make sure you note this

While we recommend to use <dfn>Template Credentials</dfn> at all times,
some use cases demand dynamic credentials for which using
<dfn>Template Credentials</dfn> is too unwieldy because of their static
nature. If you have this requirement, feel free to use the following
parameters instead: \`"bucket"\`, \`"app_key_id"\`, \`"app_key"\`.
