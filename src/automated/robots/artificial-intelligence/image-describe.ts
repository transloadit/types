Transloadit outsources this task and abstracts the interface so you can
expect the same data structures, but different latencies and information
being returned. Different cloud vendors have different areas they shine
in, and we recommend to try out and see what yields the best results for
your use case.

- \`"json"\` returns a JSON file.
- \`"meta"\` does not return a file, but stores the data inside Transloadit's
file object (under \`\${file.meta.descriptions}\`) that's passed around
between encoding <dfn>Steps</dfn>, so that you can use the values to burn
the data into videos, filter on them, etc.

provided image. Explicit descriptions include labels for nudity, violence
etc. If set to \`false\`, only non-explicit descriptions (such as human or
chair) will be returned. If set to \`true\`, only explicit descriptions will
be returned.

The possible descriptions depend on the chosen provider. The list of labels
from AWS can be found [in their documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/moderation.html#moderation-api).
GCP labels the image based on five categories, as described [in their documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/detecting-safe-search).
