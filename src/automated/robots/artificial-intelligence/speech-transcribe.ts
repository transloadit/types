Transloadit outsources this task and abstracts the interface so you can
expect the same data structures, but different latencies and information
being returned. Different cloud vendors have different areas they shine
in, and we recommend to try out and see what yields the best results for
your use case.

- \`"meta"\` does not return a file, but stores the
data inside  Transloadit's file object (under
\`\${file.meta.transcription.text}\`) that's passed around between encoding
<dfn>Steps</dfn>, so that you can use the values to burn the data into
videos, filter on them, etc.
